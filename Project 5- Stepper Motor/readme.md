ESP32 Stepper Motor Control with Custom Rotations, Direction, and Speed

ðŸ“Œ Description
This project demonstrates how to control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor using an ESP32 microcontroller and a ULN2003 driver module. The motor is programmed to:
Rotate for a configurable number of rotations
In a specific direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
At a given speed (RPM)
This simulation runs on Wokwi.
